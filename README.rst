Python package for the threedigrid administration.


* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://threedigrid.readthedocs.io.


Features
========
 - access to the threedicore administration by a single instance of the ``GridH5Admin`` object
 - query the model data by pre-defined subsets and django style filters
 - export model data to gis formats like shapefile, geopackage
 - serialize model data as geojson


Installation
============

To be able to use the full range of features you need to install the python gdal bindings.
There are several ways to accomplish this, see the following thread for an overview:

 https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/9553/installing-gdal-and-ogr-for-python


Quick start
===========

Get a grid admin instance::

    from threedigrid.gridadmin.gridadmin import GridH5Admin

    f = 'gridadmin.h5'
    ga = GridH5Admin(f)


The grid admin directly holds some model specific attributes like whether the model has a 1D or 2D
or groundwater section::

    In [4]: ga.has_groundwater
    Out[4]: False

    In [5]: ga.has_1d
    Out[5]: True


Filtering
---------

There are different types of filters but a filter, generally speaking, acts on field. That means you can
filter by value. If you have a line model instance you can filter the data by the kcu field::

    ga.lines.filter(kcu__in=[100,102])

or by the lik value::

    ga.lines.filter(lik__eq=4)

The filtering is lazy, that is, to retrieve data you have to call data explicitly::

    ga.lines.filter(lik__eq=4).data  # will return an ordered dict



Tests
=====

Tests can be run best in a docker container::

   $ cd <project_root>
   $ docker build -t threedigrid:test .
   $ docker run --rm threedigrid:test pytest --cov=threedigrid --flake8
