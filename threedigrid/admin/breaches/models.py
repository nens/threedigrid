Breaches are better described as possible breach locations
as they represent the intersection between threedicore
1d-2d flow lines and levee geometries from the models spatialite
database. That is, once the kcu (the type classifier, see :ref:`kcu-label`)
of the 1d-2d flow line has the value 56 there actually will be an active
link between the 1d and the 2d calculation nodes.

To query the ``Breaches`` model::

    >>> from threedigrid.admin.breaches.models import Breaches
    >>> from threedigrid.admin.gridadmin import GridH5Admin

    >>> f = 'gridadmin.h5'
    >>> ga = GridH5Admin(f)
    >>> # get all active breaches
    >>> ga.breaches.filter(kcu__eq=56).data
